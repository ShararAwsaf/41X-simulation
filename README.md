# 41X-simulation
Simulation For Object detection for occupancy system


Mask RCNN model: https://github.com/ayoolaolafenwa/PixelLib/releases/download/1.2/mask_rcnn_coco.h5

Put model on same level as object-detection-combined.py

`python3 object-detection-combined.py`

OPTIONAL:
In the code change the video path to the place where your video.
