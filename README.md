# 41X-simulation
Simulation For Object detection for occupancy system

How to Run:

1. Mask RCNN model: https://github.com/ayoolaolafenwa/PixelLib/releases/download/1.2/mask_rcnn_coco.h5

2. Put model on same level as object-detection-combined.py

3. `python3 object-detection-combined.py` on Terminal

4. OPTIONAL: In the code change the video path to the place where your video to use your own video.

Outputs:

1. Find detected images in `detection/output/` directory
 
2. Note the speed is not the best but accuracy is good
